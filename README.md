## Tested on

The following models and operating systems have been validated by users

- **Models**
    - 2025 Zenbook Duo (UX8406CA)

- **Distros**
    - Ubunutu 25.10

While I typicaly recommend Debian installs, and many items worked out of the box with `debian-backports`, Ubuntu 25.10 has so far proven to be the best option for compatibility of newer hardware, such as the Bluetooth module. Once Backports incorporates kernel 6.14, I may personally redo testing in Debian Bookworm.

## Install

Run the setup script below, choose a default keyboard backlight level of 0 (off) to 3 (high), and a default resolution scale.

```bash
$ ./setup.sh 
What would you like to use for the default keyboard backlight brightness [0-3]? 1
What would you like to use for monitor scale (1 = 100%, 1.5 = 150%, 2=200%) [1-2]? 1
...
<watch it install>
```

This will set up the required systemd scripts to handle all the above functionality. A log file will be created in `/tmp/duo/` when the services are running.
